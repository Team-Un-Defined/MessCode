###### Video Presentation Link - i_am_link.com

In order to run the program, Java version 11 or higher must be installed on the device.

It is also necessary to locally create the database with the following parameters:
name: MessCode
username: postgres
password: chickenattack777
And restore it from database backup file “backupName.tz”.

The program can be run using the two included JAR files, a server-side and a client program:
your_11_java_version\bin\java.exe -jar MessCode.jar
your_11_java_version\bin\java.exe -jar MessCodeServer.jar

To be able to effectively test the messenger it is recommended to run three client instances, with the employer, project manager, and worker accounts.
